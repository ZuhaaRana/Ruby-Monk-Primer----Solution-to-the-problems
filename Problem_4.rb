# Problem 4

# Problem Statement:

# Create a method 'random_select' which, when given an array of elements (array)
# and a number (n), returns n randomly selected elements from that array.

# Example:

# Given an array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and 2 should return two random numbers
# from the given array. (Note: those two random numbers may be the same number.)
# The method should return those random values in a new array.
